# gmcore

gmcore is a tiny, bare-bones game engine designed for learning.

gmcore prioritizes minimal design, clarity, simplicity, and direct control.

## Features

- easy to build/install/distribute
- `lua` as the primary programming language
- intentionally minimal API
  - you need something, you build it yourself
  - learning by building is the goal
- direct pixel access to the fixed-size game canvas

## Possible future additions

- basic image loading (likely PPM)
- simple sound generation via minimal api

## Usage

- create a project directory
- place a `game.lua` file in the directory
- run `gmcore` in the directory
- a game window opens
- edit `game.lua` and see the changes immediately
- iterate...

## Status

This project is an early concept, so the API and the features list is unstable. Expect breaking changes.
